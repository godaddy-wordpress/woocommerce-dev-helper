WooCommerce Dev Helper
======================

This is a simple and opinionated plugin for helping develop/debug mainly WooCommerce & extensions, but can be used in any WordPress project. 

**DO NOT USE ON A PRODUCTION SERVER.**

### Use Forwarded URLs

Once activated, this plugin will make WordPress use `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_HOST` for all your links instead of your site URL. No configuration needed.

We like [ForwardHQ](https://fwd.wf) for this, along with a `ForwardFile` in your WordPress root.

### WooCommerce Subscriptions

* Adds a "renew" link to each subscription in the WooCommerce > Subscriptions admin screen for easy renewal processing. This is particularly useful for testing payment gateways that supports subscriptions.

* Allows for minutes and hours-long Subscription periods for quicker testing.

### WooCommerce Memberships

* Allows for minutes and hours-long Membership lengths for quicker testing.

* Adds a bulk generator to create up to thousands of Memberships via background process for testing purposes. The Memberships, and all connected objects (plans, products, content, etc.) thus created can later be removed in the same fashion.

### Bogus Gateway

* Adds a testing payment gateway that will call the `$order->payment_complete()` method to simulate a credit card payment. Can also be used for Subscriptions automatic renewals.

### Global Functions

#### PHP

* `wp_debug_backtrace()` - helper for using the `debug_backtrace()` function with a bit more sanity
* `wp_var_dump()` - helper for `var_dump`, allowing you to return the output instead of printing
* `wp_var_log()` - helper for `error_log` that uses `print_r()` or optionally `wp_var_dump()`
* `wp_print_r()` - helper for `print_r` that wraps the output in `<pre>` HTML tags

#### JavaScript

* `wc_dev_session` - fetches and logs all the current session data in console

### Misc

* Removes the WooCommerce Updater notice.
* Removes the strong password requirement for customer accounts.
* Adds support for an HTTP helper for logging actions/filters fired during a page load -- simply add `?wcdh_hooks=actions|filters|all`, reload the page, and your desired hooks will be printed to the error log, along with the fired count.

### Installation

Download and install just like any other WordPress plugin. If you want to be really fancy, symlink it into your installs instead.
